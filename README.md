# icotoprc
Creates a PWLib PRC file based on a Windows ICO file

Based on PWLib, but that is now called PTLib and I don't know if it even supports this file format anymore.

Probably needs work before it works with modern tools/libraries and/or development environments. This is 15 years old code :-)
